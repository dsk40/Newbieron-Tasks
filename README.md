# Logistic Consignment Pricing

# Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis and modeling project that focuses on supply chain health commodity shipment and pricing data. The project aims to analyze the provided dataset to gain insights into shipment pricing, optimize logistics, and enhance operational efficiency within the supply chain.

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains information related to supply chain health commodity shipments. 
The dataset may include, but is not limited to, the following fields:

# Shipment details (e.g., shipment ID, shipment date, origin, destination)
# Commodity information (e.g., type of health commodities)
# Pricing data (e.g., shipment costs, pricing strategies)
# Other relevant attributes (e.g., shipment volume, weight, shipping method)

# Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
